# cnab-go

cnab-go is a library for building [CNAB](https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec) clients. It provides the building blocks relevant to the CNAB specification so that you may build tooling without needing to implement all aspects of the CNAB specification.

cnab-go is currently being used by [Docker App](https://github.com/docker/app), [Duffle](https://github.com/deislabs/duffle), and [Porter](https://github.com/deislabs/porter). If you'd like to see your CNAB project listed here, please submit a PR.

cnab-go is [maintained](GOVERNANCE.md) by the CNAB community. We sometimes discuss cnab-go issues during the [bi-weekly CNAB community  meeting](https://hackmd.io/s/SyGcBcwQ4), but we encourage open communication via our [issue](https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-go/issues) queue and via [PRs](https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-go/pulls). If you are interested in contributing to cnab-go, please refer to our [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
